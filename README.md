Simulation of Euler Equation in a Single Pipe

This repository provides different simulations of Euler Equations in a pipe.
In this code the task is to find the density and flux on a pipe of length of 150 km for every time step and every pipe section, given certain initial conditions. 

Here, three files are provided with three different methods of solving the equation, which can be executed with different initial conditions.
Here we apply the implicit Box Scheme and the explicit Simple Upwind Scheme on the Euler equation as well as the Simple Upwind Scheme on 
the Weymouth equation (a simplified version of the Euler Scheme).

These repo is for testing purposes only and is a helpful tool for comparisons of the methods described above.
